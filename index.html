    I have been a doctoral student at Shenzhen University since September 2024.
</p>
<p>
    I completed my undergraduate studies at Beihang University (BUAA) from September 2015 to June 2019. After a two-year gap, I pursued my master's degree at Shenzhen University, where I studied from September 2021 to June 2024.

    My passion lies in the field of artificial intelligence, with a particular interest in computer and robotic vision. I'm proficient in Python and PyTorch, and I enjoy exploring new technologies and applying them to real-world problems. I also value collaboration and believe in the power of shared knowledge to drive progress.
